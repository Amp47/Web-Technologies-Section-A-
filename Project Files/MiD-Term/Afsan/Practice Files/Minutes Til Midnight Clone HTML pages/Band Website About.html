        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          In April 2022 Minutes ’til Midnight set up camp at the legendary
          Hollywood recording studio, Sunset Sound. Home to the Doors, Van
          Halen, Prince, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones and countless others.
          Sunset Sound maintains one of the largest collections of vintage
          recording equipment from the golden era of music anywhere in the
          world. MTM chose to work in Studio 2, utilizing the vintage 70’s Neve
          console and a large assortment of tube & ribbon microphones

        <p>
          Recording live complete takes as a 5 piece, the group sought to
          capture the immediacy and energy of some of those timeless records.
          The Sunset Sessions consist of 10 songs spanning their entire career
          from early singles “Too Far” to classics like Gospel of the Throttle &
          Going Out Fighting. The Sunset Sessions were filmed in 4k, giving fans
          around the world a chance to see Minutes ’Til Midnight perform their
          best known songs (and a few hidden gems). Each song will be released
          as a single and video at monthly intervals. Investment 500,000&yen;
          for the project.
